## The Usage of Tokens Studio
Using Tokens Studio to update tokens directly from Figma is welcomed.
Sometimes, Tokens Studio may change or add $metadata and $theme tokens that had already been defined.
In case this happens, we've added *.original to assist you in reverting back to how build-tokens is expecting these files to be configured.
